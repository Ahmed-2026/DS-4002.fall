## Provenance
This dataset was collected by students enrolled in the University of Virginia DS-4002 course in January 2025. Survey responses were gathered using a Google Form distributed within UVA student communities. The survey asked two questions to capture class year and each studentâ€™s personal classification of whether a hot dog is considered a sandwich. All responses were anonymous. The raw data was cleaned and prepared for analysis by removing incomplete responses and standardizing answer formats.
