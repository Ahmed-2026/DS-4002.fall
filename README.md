## About the course
The objective of this course is for students to gain experience working on data-driven 
problems while developing the ability to critique their own work and the work of others 
productively. The key element that separates this course from traditional courses is that it 
is driven by student-led projects. Students will be asked to set the expectations for the 
course, contribute to its tactical objectives, and provide critical feedback to peers. Aside 
from providing datasets and infrastructure support, setting high-level project goals, and 
offering mentorship and technical guidance, the instructors will serve primarily in 
advisory capacities for the student teams.

The class meets in-person; attendance is compulsory. If circumstances arise that preclude 
attendance at a particular session, students are to notify group members and the instructor 
as soon as possible so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged (for example a 
death in the family). Group work outside of class is expected (on average project teams meet once a week outside of class). Students will be assigned to 
small groups to work together on three projects throughout the semester. Groups will be 
assigned after the first two weeks of class (aka the fundamental training period)

## What you will learn 
Data Science is a broad, elusive, and dynamic field best learned via hands-on experience. 
Topics in this course are selected to reinforce this perspective and help students understand 
the field’s core ideas and what is demanded from practicing data scientists. An ideal 
outcome would be for students to gain a perspective on the breadth of the field of data 
science, understand important tools and environments, and develop skills necessary to 
contribute to the community. Learning objectives include:
* Cognitive
  * research ideas in a domain and create a testable hypothesis/model
  * develop a project plan based on the scientific method principles
  * establish data sets relevant to your hypothesis/model
  * create a functioning data science pipeline
  * prepare findings for presentation to your peers
  * and more objectives that you want to add (e.g. training neural networks)
* Social
  * Collaborate with peers to implement your project plan
  * Provide constructive criticism
  * Demonstrate appropriate behavior in group settings
* Psychomotor
  * Present results of a team project and field audience questions


## How You’ll Know You Are Learning (Assessments)
This class uses the Specifications grading system. Like a more traditional system the course is broken up into assignments but they are all graded on a single-level rubric system. For many students it is an unfamiliar system and requires a little adjustment but once you get used to it you will really enjoy the benefits. Details are here: [Grading Policy](grading.md). Alignment to the learning objectives is shown in the individual rubrics.

## A few Policies that will Govern the Class
Attendance Policy: The majority of the project work for this class is done during class. As such attendance is part of the course grade. Details are in the grading details page [Grading Policy](grading.md).

There are many additional policies that this course inherits from the School of Data Science course policies, please see
